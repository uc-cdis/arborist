      description: >-
        Ask arborist to check authorization on a user request. A client of the
        Gen3 auth stack sends the user's JWT to this endpoint, along with the
        information about the user's specific request. The terminology used to
        describe user requests is flexible and arborist does not "nail it down";
        however our usage so far is to use the permission model to capture the
        basic set of operations one might expect in ABAC (read/write, etc.)
        combined with the client service, and the path for the resource the user
        is trying to access. If the given JWT has `azp` field, the permission of
        the corresponding client will be also checked; only when both the user
        and the client have permission can the response be positive.
