# Arborist username endpoints design

This document describes how Arborist should behave when the user is or is not known to Arborist.

(Note: As of 2019-Nov-13 this is not yet how Arborist _actually_ behaves.)

## Context

Arborist always has 2 default groups:
- The "anonymous" group contains _all_ users, regardless of whether they are authenticated. This group has access to all the policies listed in the user.yaml's "anonymous_policies" list.
- The "logged-in" group contains all _authenticated_ users, regardless of whether they are known to Arborist. This group has access to all the policies listed in the user.yaml's "all_users_policies" list.

Some Arborist endpoints require a username (or a JWT to get the username from).

Services that communicate with Arborist (Windmill, Peregrine, Fence...) need the user's _complete_ list of resources, so they should receive anonymous and logged-in policies. But when Arborist receives the username as a query parameter, it doesnâ€™t know if the user is logged in. Should it then return the logged-in policies or not?

## Rationale

The `auth/...` endpoints are part of a client-facing API. They should return everything the current user actually has access to. If a JWT is specified, we assume the user is logged in. If a username is specified, we assume we want to know what access the user has when logged in.

The `user/...` endpoints are part of an admin-facing API, so returning a 404 error when the specified user is not known better reflects the state of the database. If an admin hits the `user/{username}` endpoint to find out what permissions a user has, the assumption is that the admin wants to know what access the user has when logged in, so we should return anonymous _and_ logged-in policies.

If we need the list of anonymous or logged-in policies, we can hit the `group/{groupname}` endpoint.

## GET, POST auth/mapping and GET auth/resources endpoints

The `auth/mapping` endpoint accepts a username as an optional query parameter. If the username is not specified, we try to get it from the JWT. The `auth/resources` endpoints only uses the JWT.

These endpoints return everything the user has access to, including anonymous and logged-in policies, following this logic:
- Username is specified and it is in Arborist's database: return user's policies + anonymous and logged-in policies.
- Username is specified but it is not in Arborist's database: return anonymous and logged-in policies.
- No username can be found: return the anonymous policies.

>Background: Originally `auth/mapping` only took the username from a query parameter. Then the revproxy needed to expose the endpoint so that Windmill could hit it. But we couldn't allow users to hit `auth/mapping` with arbitrary usernames. So the revproxy does not forward any query parameters, and we added the JWT fallback in Arborist.

## GET user/{username} and GET user/{username}/... endpoints

These endpoints have the username as a mandatory query parameter.
- Username is in Arborist's database: return user's policies + anonymous and logged-in policies.
- Username is not in Arborist's database: 404 error.
- Username is not provided: error.
